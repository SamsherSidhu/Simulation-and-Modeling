# Simulation-and-Modeling
This GitHub repository is a collection of 8 projects for a computer engineering simulations class, designed to explore different aspects of physics, mathematics, and computer science. 
1. Ball Bouncing
2. Gravitational Physics
3. Planetary Orbits
4. Crystal Lattices
5. Cellular Automata
6. Logic Networks
7. SPICE
8. FlameFrame: A 2D Forest Fire Simulation using Cellular Automata

Each project is designed to challenge students to apply their knowledge of computer engineering and programming to solve complex simulation problems, and gain hands-on experience with popular simulation tools and techniques. From modeling the motion of bouncing balls to simulating complex electrical circuits, each project provides a unique opportunity to explore the principles of simulation and develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, this repository is a valuable resource for anyone interested in computer engineering simulations. With clear instructions, sample code, and detailed explanations of each project, you'll be able to dive right in and start building your own simulations in no time.
